Do you forget to call your family and friends? Do you constantly have to be reminded to call your loved once?
Remember to Call is a simple app to help you track how long it has been since you have contacted your contact. 
You can add contacts from your phone to the app and set in how many days you would like to be reminded. The app sends you a notification so you know that it's time to call!

Remember to call is a great way to keep in touch!
